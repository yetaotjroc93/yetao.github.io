<script src="_pages/paper.js"></script>

I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, working with [Prof. Anand Sarwate](https://adsarwate.github.io). I earned my Master's degree in Electronic Engineering and Information Science in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Bin Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kReWULQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and my Bachelor's degree in Information Security in 2017, both from the University of Science and Technology of China(USTC).

My research interests lie in efficient AI (Learning with reject option and Dyna-Style Model-Based RL), Human activity recognition (inductive sensing and WiFi-based recognition) and LLM Collaboration (LLM Route, human–computer interaction).

Recognizing that many researchers rely on well-structured templates to guide LLMs, we propose a concise prompt engineering method to write LP documents so LLMs can better be involved in code generation. We also examine the capacity of various LLMs to generate Scheme and Python code on the RepoBench benchmark, illustrating the advantages of our approach. Our findings indicate that ILP with LLMs can enhance LLM-based code generation in large-scale project development.",

Internship Experience
======

### On Accuracy of Delay and Extrapolate Method in Online Misalignment Estimation
**Position:** Research Intern  
**Location:** Bell Lab, USA  
**Duration:** June 2022 - August 2022  
**Advisor:** Carl Nuzman, Shirin Jalali  
- We rigorously analyze the accuracy and effectiveness of the classic method “delay and extrapolate” for estimating the misalignment error when applied to the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm.
- Our analysis for mean squared error of filter coefficients made corrections to similar, well-known results in the previous LMS literature. [report](/files/bell_lab.pdf)

### Tessutivo: Contextual Interactions on Interactive Fabrics with Inductive Sensing
**Position:** Research Intern  
**Location:** Dartmouth College, USA  
**Duration:** December 2018 - April 2019  
**Advisor:** Xing-Dong Yang  
- Proposed Tessutivo, a contact-based inductive sensing technique for contextual interactions on interactive fabrics.
- Built a prototype containing coils made of conductive thread with maximized sensitivity conducted by a new inductance approximation formula.
